# The Movie Database Clone 🎬

TMDB is a **CRUD** application.
 It's a **Source For Latest Movies and TV Shows Updates** with interactive features that gives you the chance to do things like sharing your movie reviews with other people in the "movie geeks 🍕" community or bookmarking movies on your account to create your own watchlist  .

 The UI is made with **ReactJs** and it is a clone of the famous website [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) . For backend I relied on [TMDB API services](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)  ( Version 3) . 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furatmalkawi29/the-movie-database-clone.git
cd the-movie-database-clone
npm install or yarn install
```

## Start the server

```bash
npm start or yarn start
```
Now enter  [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/)  in the address bar of your browser.

## About TMDB APIs 🔐

API services were available on the website with all of the details including payload and response examples .
 You need to signup and get your own API key  to be able to try them out  .

>  Our API is a system we provide for you and your team to programmatically fetch and use our data and/or images.

## Technical Description 🔮
 I did my best following Clean Code Principles, by making reusable components as much as possible, depending on certain patterns and an organized file structure. 
 
✅ **Pure CSS** without using libraries like bootstrap/tailwind .
✅ **Used Scss** as a css-preprocessor
✅ **Responsive** 
✅ **ReactJs** :  Functional components + hooks 
✅ **React Redux** for state management 
✅ **Axios** library
✅ **40+ End points** connected all over the app (TMDB     V3 APIs) 
✅ **Authentication** (TMDB Auth APIs)
