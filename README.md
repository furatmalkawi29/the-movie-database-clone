# The Movie Database Clone 🎬

TMDB is a **CRUD** application.
 It's a **Source For Latest Movies and TV Shows Updates** with interactive features that gives you the chance to do things like sharing your movie reviews with other people in the "movie geeks 🍕" community or bookmarking movies on your account to create your own watchlist  .

 The UI is made with **ReactJs** and it is a clone of the famous website [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) . For backend I relied on [TMDB API services](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)  ( Version 3) .

## Live website 🔗 
The project is deployed using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can view it using this [`link`](https://vocal-sherbet-e8a780.netlify.app/) .

## Technical Description 🔮
 I did my best following Clean Code Principles, by making **reusable components** as much as possible, depending on certain patterns and an organized file structure. 
 
✅ **Pure CSS** without using libraries like bootstrap/tailwind in making app componnets .\
✅ **Used Scss** as a css-preprocessor\
✅ **Responsive** \
✅ **ReactJs** :  Functional components + hooks \
✅ **React Redux** for state management \
✅ **Axios** library\
✅ **40+ End points** connected all over the app (TMDB     V3 APIs) \
✅ **Authentication** (TMDB Auth APIs)
