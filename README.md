# The Movie Database Clone 🎬

TMDB is a **CRUD** application.
 It's a **Source For Latest Movies and TV Shows Updates** with interactive features that gives you the chance to do things like sharing your movie reviews with other people in the "movie geeks 🍕" community or bookmarking movies on your account to create your own watchlist  .

 The UI is made with **ReactJs** and it is a clone of the famous website [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) . For backend I relied on [TMDB API services](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)  ( Version 3) .

## Technical Description 🔮
 I did my best following Clean Code Principles, by making **reusable components** as much as possible, depending on certain patterns and an organized file structure. 
 
✅ **Pure CSS** without using libraries like bootstrap/tailwind in making app componnets .\
✅ **Used Scss** as a css-preprocessor\
✅ **Responsive** \
✅ **ReactJs** :  Functional components + hooks \
✅ **React Redux** for state management \
✅ **Axios** library\
✅ **40+ End points** connected all over the app (TMDB     V3 APIs) \
✅ **Authentication** (TMDB Auth APIs)

## About TMDB APIs 🔐

TMDB API services were available on the website with all of the details including payload and response examples .\
 You need to signup and get your own API key  to be able to try them out  .

>  Our API is a system we provide for you and your team to programmatically fetch and use our data and/or images.
